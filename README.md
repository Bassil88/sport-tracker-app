   # React Progress History and Workout Scheme Project

The project is deployed and can be accessed [here](https://workout-tracker-react-app.netlify.app).


This React application has two main features:
1. **Progress History:** It visualizes workout progress using **charts** **:)** 

2. **Workout Scheme:** It allows users to create and track workout schemes.

The Progress History component fetches exercise data from an API and uses the Recharts library to create two charts:

 - Exercise Category Chart: Shows the number of exercises in each category.
 - Calorie Chart: Displays calories burned for each exercise.

The Workout Scheme component enables users to manage exercises, sets, and includes a workout timer.

 # Dependencies:

 - React
 - @mui/material
 - Recharts
 - react-icons

**Styling:** This project utilizes the Tailwind CSS framework for styling the application.

This project showcases React usage, API data fetching, chart creation with Recharts, and state management with hooks.
